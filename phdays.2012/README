Crackme from "best reverser" contest held during PHDays 2012
(http://phdays.com/program/contests/#6323). Only one person provided an
incomplete solution (mr Skylarov). The problem was that crackme has a bug
in the second stage (uninitialzied stack variable).

I solved the first stage in time, but figured I won't be able to finish
stage2 before deadline, so I didn't even analyze it and did not submit
my partial solution.

ESET crackme released during BlackHat 2012 is a modified version of this
one. The only difference is that the bug was fixed and stages are swapped
:P.

I ran the BH crackme under a debugger just few times and completely missed
the part where a stack pointer is overwritten -- I guess I implicitly assumed
that this kind of solution would be considered "patching". Lesson: some
authors don't allow in memory modifications, others do :P.
