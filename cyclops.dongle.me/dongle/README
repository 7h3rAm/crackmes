Dongle Me by cyclops
--------------------

This a hardware solution for dongle me by cyclops. You will need to acquire
a Teensy compatible dongle, or build one yourself.

The keygen generates a correct ECNR signature for current user's username 
and transmits it to the dongle. Dongle stores it in EEPROM and peridically 
sends the signature to the OS.

You will need:
- teensy (www.pjrc.com/teensy), or a compatible clone
- mingw compiler
- WinAVR
- unix utils (not essential, but used in makefile)
- miracl library (www.shamus.ie), but only for headers, you don't need to
  compile it -- necessary .o files are in \mingw-obj folder
- FLIP 3.4.3 (http://goo.gl/ZRqFD), but only if you are using a clone and
  the original Teensy loader doesn't work for you

Installation:
- go to usb_rawhid dir. and change "MCU" in makefile, to match the processor
  you are using. When done, build example.hex with "make".
- using FLIP, or the original Teensy loader, load example.hex onto the
  dongle. There should be a button on the dongle, don't forget to keep it
  pressed when plugging it in, otherwise you won't be able to program it.
- Unplug the dongle and plug it again, but without pressing the button. This
  will allow your program to run.
- Go to \kg directory and build with "make". 
- Run kg.exe to send necessary information to the dongle.
- Done. Your dongle will be accepted by the crackme, but only on system 
  accounts you run kg.exe under (usernames must match, otherwise you will 
  need to reprogram).
